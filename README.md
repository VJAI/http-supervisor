# ðŸ‘® http-supervisor

## Intro

A simple tool that helps to audit HTTP requests and identify the requests that exceeds the set quota. It also helps to group, sort and query requests based upon 
a variety of parameters.

The tool renders a simple UI that provides controls to capture the requests and print to console in a better readable format. It also provides a global object for you 
to manage requests.
