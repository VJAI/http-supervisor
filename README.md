# ðŸ‘® http-supervisor

## Intro

A simple tool that helps to audit HTTP requests and identify the requests that exceeds the set quota. It also helps to group, sort, search and export requests.

The tool renders a simple UI that provides controls to capture the requests and print to console in a better readable format. It also provides a global object for you 
to work with requests from developer console.

Last but not least it also provides visualization support using the chart.js library.

## Features

- Auditing Requests By Setting Quota
- Searching, Grouping And Sorting Requests
- Printing Requests
- Exporting Requests As CSV
- Exporting / Importing Configuration
- Visualization Through Charts
- Watching Requests
- Copying Requests


## Install

Currently it's available in `npm`. There are plans to make it available as a browser addon.

```shell
npm i http-supervisor --save-dev
``` 

The library exports a single object called `http` through which you can control the audit and manage the requests.


## Initializing Supervisor

The `init` method helps to configure and initialize the tool. You should call this method to start the audit and it can be called only once.

```js
http.init({
  include: ['https://my.api.com'],
  alertOnError: true
})
```

You can pass a bunch of parameters to the `init` method to configure the tool which you can see at the API section.


## Starting Audit

Calling the `init` method start the audit. If you stopped it for some reason and you can restart it by calling the `start` method.

```js
http.start();
```


## Stopping Audit

You can temporarily stop auditing by calling `stop` method.

```js
http.stop();
```


## Getting Requests

The library provides a method called `query` that gives you all the captured requests in a custom collection.

```js
const requests = http.query();
```

The output of the `query` method is a custom collection extended from array that helps you to search, group and sort requests.

You can get a single request by passing the `id` to the `get` method.

```js
const request = http.get(1);
```

The output request is of type `HttpRequestInfo`.


## Sorting Requests

You can multi-sort the requests.

```js
const requests = http.sort({ field: 'method', dir: 'asc' }, { field: 'responseSize', dir: 'desc' });
```


## Grouping Requests

You can group and sub-group requests.

```js
const requests = http.group('path', 'method');
```

There are also methods available that helps to group and sort in the same call.


## Searching Requests

You can also search requests on different fields passing different operators.

```js
const requests = http.query('/token');
const requests = http.query('GET');
const requests = http.query('responseSize', '>', '1 kb');
const requests = http.query({ field: 'responseSize', operator: '>', value: '1 kb' });
```


## Printing Requests

Calling the `print` method displays the requests in console using the default group and sort parameters.

```js
http.print()
```

The method accepts different kind of parameters to search, group and sort the requests before printing. You can also 
pass a request or collection to this method and that'll be printed.

### Printing a request passing id

Each http request is associated with a unique id. You can print the details of a single request by just passing the id.

```js
http.print(id);
```

### Printing requests of a particular http method

You can print requests belongs to a particular http method (GET, POST etc.) by passing the http method name.

```js
http.print('GET');
```

### Printing requests matches an url

By passing an url (relative/absolute) the methods prints all the requests belongs to it.

```js
http.print('/api/v3');
```

You can also pass glob patterns.

```js
http.print('https://api.domain.com/v3/*');
```

### Search, group, sort and then print requests

The method also accepts search, group and sort parameters that'll be applied over the requests before printing them.

```js
http.print(
  [{field: 'method', operator: '=', value: 'GET'}], // search
  ['url', 'method'], // group
  [{ field: 'responseSize', dir: 'desc' }] //sort
);
```

If you want to only sort you can pass `null` to search and group parameters.

### Printing any request or collection

You can pass any request or collection to the print method and it'll print it.

```
http.print(request);
http.print(collection);
```


## Exporting Requests

You can export requests as CSV/JSON by calling the `export` method.

```js
http.export(); // export as CSV
http.export('json') // export as JSON
```


## Exporting / Importing Configuration

You can export the configuration of supervisor by passing `true` as the last argument.

```js
http.export('json', true);
```

You can import a saved configuration by calling the `import` method.

```js
http.import();
```


## Visualizing Requests

The library provides methods to visualize data through charts. The `timeChart` method prints the time taken by each request through a bar chart. 
There are other methods to visualize different information please check the API section.

```
http.timeChart()
```


## API

### `HttpSupervisor` Properties
